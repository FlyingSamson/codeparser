## Nodes

All nodes have a uniform structure:

`Node[tag or operator, contents or children, opts]`







# Compatibility

AST aims to be source compatible for Mathematica versions >= 11.0





# Caveats


CAVEAT 1:

line continuations are lost

12\
3

has same concrete syntax as

123



In[8]:= ConcreteParseString["12\\\n34"]

Out[8]= LeafNode[Integer, "1234", <|Source -> {{1, 1}, {2, 2}}|>]






CAVEAT 2:

linear syntax is not parsed, just tokenized









there is an analogy here:

if a character is not something else, then it is letterlike

if a token is not something else, then it is prefix

if an expression is not something else, then it is leaf
